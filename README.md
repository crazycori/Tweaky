# Tweaky
Tool that applies automated patches for some linux issues
This tool must be ran as root

This is a work in process
No functions are connected except new patch for ALC294 Pipewire :D

Again, this is a work in process
Don't build this, unless you understand what you're doing
Remember to make backups before modifying system files
